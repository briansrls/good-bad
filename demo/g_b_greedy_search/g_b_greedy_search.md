Design Document: G-B Enhanced Greedy Search Algorithm
1. Introduction & Motivation

1.1. Problem Statement:

Many search and optimization problems (e.g., maze solving, pathfinding in graphs, resource navigation) are tackled by greedy algorithms due to their simplicity and speed.

However, standard greedy algorithms, relying on single-dimensional heuristics, often get stuck in local optima or fail to navigate complex scenarios involving risks, ambiguities, or conflicting objectives effectively.

1.2. Proposed Solution: G-B Enhanced Greedy Search:

Introduce an enhanced greedy algorithm leveraging Good/Bad (G-B) logic.

Each potential state/node or action will be evaluated using a G-B pair (G, B), representing its perceived positive potential/alignment with goals (Goodness) and negative potential/risk/cost (Badness).

This allows for a more nuanced representation of choices, accommodating ambiguity and trade-offs.

1.3. Hypothesized Benefits (The "Emotional Component"):

Improved Solution Quality: Better navigation of complex decision landscapes by avoiding local optima and "traps" that a uni-dimensional heuristic might fall for.

Enhanced Robustness: Better handling of ambiguous or conflicting information within the search space, reflecting G-B logic's paraconsistent nature.

Adaptive Search through Retroactive Updates: The algorithm can "learn" from its exploration by updating G/B values of previously visited nodes/paths based on subsequent discoveries, refining its "emotional" assessment of the search space. This aligns with the EOR model where experiences refine emotional responses.

This approach aims to embed a form of "L1 consciousness" (evaluating current inputs/choices as good/bad) and potentially elements of "L2/L3 consciousness" (more versatile good/bad feelings, pattern recognition through updates) into the search process.

2. Goals & Scope

2.1. Goals:

Design a G-B enhanced greedy search algorithm applicable to problems like maze solving and graph pathfinding.

Define mechanisms for calculating and utilizing G/B values for decision-making.

Implement a method for retroactively updating G/B values of nodes.

Outline a plan to benchmark the G-B enhanced algorithm against standard greedy algorithms.

2.2. Non-Goals (for this version):

A full theoretical proof of universal time-complexity improvement (focus is on solution quality and robustness).

Highly complex, dynamic G/B calculation functions that require extensive machine learning (start with simpler, rule-based or model-based G/B functions).

Replacing optimal algorithms like A* where optimality is guaranteed and required (greedy algorithms are heuristics).

3. Algorithm Design: G-B Enhanced Greedy Search

3.1. Data Structures:

Nodes/States: Standard representation (e.g., coordinates in a maze, node ID in a graph).

G-B Values Storage: Each node n will store associated G(n) and B(n) values. These can be initialized (e.g., G=0, B=0 or based on some prior) and updated.

Graph/Maze Representation: Adjacency list, matrix, or grid.

Open List/Frontier: To keep track of nodes to visit (standard for many search algorithms, though less central to a simple greedy approach, it might be useful for variations or if backtracking with G-B updates is considered).

3.2. Core Algorithm Logic:

Initialization:

Initialize G/B values for all nodes (or lazily as they are encountered). Default could be (G=0, B=0) or based on some initial heuristic (e.g., G related to distance to goal).

Start node s, Goal node g.

Current path P_current = [s].

Visited set (to avoid simple cycles, can be enhanced by G-B context).

Iteration:

Let curr be the last node in P_current.

If curr is g, terminate (Goal Reached).

Identify all valid neighboring/next states N = {n_1, n_2, ..., n_k} from curr that are not in P_current (to avoid immediate cycles, more sophisticated cycle detection might be needed).

If N is empty, terminate (Stuck/Dead End).

For each neighbor n_i in N:

Calculate G-B Heuristic V(n_i) = (G_h(n_i), B_h(n_i)) for the move to n_i or the state n_i:

G_h(n_i): Factors could include:

Inverse of estimated distance to goal from n_i.

Presence of positive features at n_i or along edge (curr, n_i).

Stored G(n_i) if already visited/evaluated.

B_h(n_i): Factors could include:

Estimated cost to reach n_i from curr.

Presence of negative features at n_i or along edge (curr, n_i).

Stored B(n_i) if already visited/evaluated (e.g., if it's known to be trap-adjacent).

Penalty for re-visiting (if allowed under certain G-B conditions).

Decision Rule (The "Greedy" Choice):

Select the next node n_next from N based on their G-B heuristic values V(n_i). Examples:

Maximize G_h(n_i).

Minimize B_h(n_i).

Maximize a combined score: Score(n_i) = w_g * G_h(n_i) - w_b * B_h(n_i) (where w_g, w_b are weights).

Lexicographical: Maximize G_h(n_i), then among those with similar G, minimize B_h(n_i).

Threshold-based: Choose n_i with highest G_h(n_i) provided B_h(n_i) < B_threshold.

If no suitable n_next is found (e.g., all options have unacceptably high B_h), terminate (Stuck/Pruned).

Add n_next to P_current.

Termination & Outcome Assessment:

If Goal g is reached: Path found. Outcome = SUCCESS.

If Stuck/Dead End/Pruned: Path not found. Outcome = FAILURE (or specific reason).

Retroactive G-B Update Mechanism (Post-Exploration/Discovery):

Based on the Outcome and P_current:

Iterate backwards along P_current (or a relevant portion of it, e.g., last k steps).

For each node n_j in this path (and potentially edges):

Update its stored G(n_j) and B(n_j) values.

FAILURE (Trap Encountered on path): For nodes on the path leading to the trap, significantly increase their stored B values. Potentially decrease G values.

FAILURE (Dead End at P_current.last()): Increase stored B for P_current.last() and its immediate predecessors on P_current.

SUCCESS (Goal Reached): Potentially increase stored G for nodes on the successful path (reinforcement). Decrease B if they were previously considered risky but proved safe.

The magnitude and propagation of updates are parameters to be tuned.

3.3. Comparison with Standard Greedy:

Heuristic: Single scalar value vs. (G,B) pair.

Decision: Simple max/min vs. potentially more complex rule based on G & B.

Adaptation: Standard greedy is typically static regarding node evaluation; G-B enhanced version can adapt its stored node evaluations via retroactive updates, influencing future decisions if the search is run multiple times or in an ongoing process.

4. Example Walkthrough (Conceptual)

Consider a small grid maze (e.g., 5x5) with a start (S), an end (E), and a "trap" zone (T).

Initial State: Nodes have default G/B (e.g., G based on Manhattan distance to E, B=0).

Run 1:

Algorithm explores, using a decision rule like "Maximize G_h provided B_h is low."

Suppose it paths through n1 -> n2 -> T (hits trap).

Retroactive Update: B(T) becomes very high. B(n2) increases significantly. B(n1) increases moderately.

Run 2 (or if search continues/re-evaluates):

When considering n2, its stored B(n2) is now high.

The decision rule will likely avoid n2 if other paths have lower B_h, even if their G_h is slightly less appealing than n2's original G_h. The algorithm "learns" to be wary of the path to T.

5. Benchmarking Plan

5.1. Metrics:

Solution Quality:

Success rate (percentage of runs finding the goal).

Path cost/length (for successful runs).

Optimality gap (comparison to known optimal solutions, if available).

Frequency of encountering "traps" or high-penalty areas.

Exploration Efficiency:

Number of nodes expanded/evaluated.

Computational time (acknowledging potential per-step overhead of G-B calculation but aiming for overall efficiency in finding good solutions).

5.2. Problem Sets:

Mazes:

Standard benchmark mazes of varying sizes and densities.

Custom-designed mazes with explicit "trap" regions, "misleading paths" (locally good, globally bad), and paths requiring trade-offs between length and risk.

Graph Pathfinding:

Graphs with varying edge costs/weights.

Graphs where low-local-cost edges lead to high-cost global paths (greedy traps).

Graphs with nodes/edges having associated risk factors (to be modeled into B values).

5.3. Comparison Algorithms:

Standard Greedy (Best-First Search with common heuristics like Manhattan distance, Euclidean distance for mazes; lowest edge cost for graphs).

Random Walk (as a baseline for search effectiveness).

Potentially A* or Dijkstra's to establish optimal solution benchmarks (not for direct greedy comparison but for evaluating solution quality).

6. Expected Outcomes & Hypotheses

The G-B enhanced greedy algorithm will achieve higher success rates and/or find better quality solutions (e.g., lower cost, fewer traps hit) in complex environments with misleading local optima or explicit risks, compared to standard greedy algorithms.

The retroactive update mechanism will demonstrate learning/adaptation, leading to improved performance over successive trials or in dynamic scenarios.

While the per-step computation for G-B evaluation might be higher, the overall "cost" to find a satisfactory solution (considering solution quality and penalties) may be lower for G-B enhanced greedy in challenging problems.

7. Potential Challenges & Limitations

Defining G and B Functions: The effectiveness heavily relies on the design of G and B calculation functions. These need to be carefully crafted and may require domain-specific tuning.

Decision Rule Complexity: Choosing an appropriate rule to combine G and B for decision-making is critical.

Update Mechanism Tuning: Determining the magnitude, propagation distance, and conditions for retroactive G/B updates will require experimentation.

Computational Overhead: The calculation of G/B values and their updates will introduce computational overhead compared to simpler heuristics. The balance between richer evaluation and speed needs to be managed.

Parameter Tuning: The algorithm will likely have several parameters (weights for G/B in decision rule, update factors) that need tuning.

8. Future Work

Develop more sophisticated and adaptive methods for G and B calculation (e.g., incorporating global state information, learning from past experiences more deeply).

Explore advanced G-B decision-making strategies, potentially drawing from multi-criteria decision analysis.

Investigate the theoretical properties of convergence or solution quality under specific G-B function classes and update rules.

Apply the framework to a wider range of dynamic or partially observable environments.

Extend to multi-agent systems where agents can share and benefit from a collectively updated G-B map of the environment.
