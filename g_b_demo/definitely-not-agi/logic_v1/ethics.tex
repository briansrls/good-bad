\section{Introduction}

This paper proposes an intersubjective perspective on ethics and morality, with an \emph{analogy} to mathematics as a guiding illustration rather than a direct equivalence. The central argument is that morality should be understood as a framework of collectively negotiated values and principles, rather than an absolute, externally existing truth or a purely private, subjective phenomenon. By focusing on the intersubjective dimension, we gain insight into how moral systems emerge, stabilize, and remain open to revision as societies evolve.

\section{Ethics and Morality as Intersubjective Frameworks}

Ethics and morality address questions like: \emph{What is right and wrong? How should one live? What is our obligation to others?} These questions invariably involve multiple agents who share a social space. Unlike strictly personal preferences (subjectivity) or hypothesized objective moral laws (objectivity), moral judgments commonly occupy a collective realm of agreed-upon guidelines that shape behavior and social norms. We call this realm \textbf{intersubjective}, in which stability arises from shared understanding rather than from presumed external reality or purely individual opinion.

\subsection{Why Intersubjectivity?}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Shared Norms and Values:} Moral systems often hinge on mutual recognition of rules (e.g., respect for autonomy, harm prevention). These become meaningful only when shared by community members.
  \item \textbf{Negotiation and Adaptation:} Society continually revises moral principles in response to new contexts, reflecting a collective, evolving consensus rather than static law.
  \item \textbf{Imperfect Knowledge:} Each moral agent sees the world through personal experiences. Intersubjective ethics acknowledges this partiality, seeking frameworks that accommodate diverse perspectives.
\end{itemize}

\section{The Mathematics Analogy}

Mathematics offers a helpful analogy for understanding how intersubjective systems can function without claiming absolute, external existence. In mathematics:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Axioms and definitions guide consistent reasoning.
  \item Conventions evolve, yet maintain internal coherence.
  \item Practitioners achieve widespread consensus on proofs and results, despite no requirement that these structures exist outside human frameworks.
\end{itemize}

Similarly, moral systems:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Rely on socially accepted axioms or principles (e.g., the value of well-being, fairness, or autonomy).
  \item Adapt to novel situations while preserving internal coherence (logically consistent moral reasoning).
  \item Achieve consensus through communal discourse, debate, and cultural evolution, rather than by appealing to an objective moral reality.
\end{itemize}

The analogy is intended to illustrate how a system can be stable, rigorous, and broadly agreed upon, even if it does not derive from an objectively verifiable external source.

\section{Clarifying the Nature of Ethics and Morality}

\subsection{Common Pitfalls}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Objective Morality Claim:} The idea that moral truths exist independently of humans. This view struggles to find conclusive proof in a world of subjective experience.
  \item \textbf{Subjective Relativism:} The notion that moral truths are entirely personal opinions, ignoring the shared rules and expectations crucial to social functioning.
  \item \textbf{Conflation with Absolutes:} Assuming that if morals are not objective, they are therefore baseless. Intersubjectivity demonstrates a middle ground of collective grounding.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Moral Consensus and Diversity}

Intersubjective morality acknowledges that individuals and societies do not always agree, but can still arrive at workable shared norms. Disagreements reveal moral frameworks as dynamic and open to negotiation, reflecting both cultural diversity and the need for communal coherence.

\section{Implications and Conclusion}

Seeing ethics as an intersubjective framework clarifies how moral systems can be both deeply felt and collectively negotiated. This perspective:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Emphasizes the social nature of morality, rooted in shared discourse and mutual adaptation.
  \item Rejects the strict dichotomy between absolute moral reality and purely private preference.
  \item Offers a clear path for moral progress: refining our principles through dialogue, reason, and empathy.
\end{enumerate}

As the mathematics analogy illustrates, robust systems can exist without needing to claim an external, universal ontology. Morality, similarly, remains effective and deeply meaningful when understood as the product of communal and rational engagement. It is in this intersubjective, evolving space that ethical truths are shaped, tested, and refined over time.
